## Current State

**Database:** V2 schema deployed. Migrations through `20260324000000_feedback_reports` (feedback/reports table, storage bucket). Real data: City View org with admin account (Daniel Lang), staff users, and multiple activities.

**Application:**

| Auth & navigation | Built | — |
| **Admin** | | |
| Activity management (CRUD, detail modal, behavior flags, staff, enrollment roster) | Built | `activity-detail-and-form-redesign-spec.md`, `activity-management-overhaul-build-spec.md` |
| User management (CRUD, bulk paste-from-spreadsheet entry) | Built | — |
| Dashboard & agenda view (week grid, block grouping, adaptive cards, tooltips) | Built, polish deferred | `agenda-view-build-spec.md`, `admin-dashboard.md`, #3, #6 |
| Enrollment — activity-centric (Entry A) | Built | `enrollment-panel-build-spec.md` |
| Enrollment — student-centric (Entry B) | Designed, not built | #7 |
| Org settings (block schedule, terms, rotation days) | Built | `org-settings-build-spec.md` |
| Calendar management (school days, exceptions, per-reason rotation) | Built | `calendar-management-build-spec.md`, #12 |
| Student schedule view | Designed, waiting on decisions to finalize | `student-schedule-view-build-spec.md` |
| User feedback & bug reporting (/help page, FeedbackModal, Edge Function) | Built | `user-feedback-system-build-spec.md` |
| Reports | Placeholder | — |
| **Student** | | |
| Today view / agenda | Built | `student-agenda-today-view-build-spec.md` |
| Check-in flows | Built | `student-actions-build-spec.md` |
| **Teacher** | | |
| Dashboard / agenda | Built | `teacher-agenda-build-spec.md` |
| Attendance marking | Built | `teacher-agenda-build-spec.md` |
| Student action visibility | Built | `teacher-roster-student-actions-build-spec.md` |
| **Infrastructure** | | |
| Hooks / TanStack Query layer | Built | — |
| Zustand stores (auth, UI/agenda focus) | Built | — |
| Enrollment validation (block-based + time-based) | Built | `src/lib/enrollmentValidation.js` |
| RLS policies | Comprehensive--all tables, all roles | `2026031300000_comprehensive_rls_policies.sql`, `10-rls-policies.md` |
| Edge Functions (`submit-feedback`, `create-user`) | Deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`; config in `supabase/config.toml` | Session 16 |
| Realtime subscriptions | Not started | — |

## Active Decisions

Decisions that are settled live in CLAUDE.md (if they're lasting architectural principles) or in the relevant spec doc (if they're feature-specific). This section is only for genuinely open questions affecting near-term work.

*None currently.* Check GitHub Issues for planned work.

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

Tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/danlang422/here-app/issues) and synced with Linear. Claude.ai can access issues through the Linear MCP integration. Claude Code access is detailed in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Next Steps

Tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/danlang422/here-app/issues).

**Current priority:** User feedback system is complete. Daniel is entering remaining schedule data. Next major feature TBD — candidates include Student Schedule View integration placement, activity page polish, and agenda blob fix.
