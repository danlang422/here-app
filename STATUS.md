## 📝 Notes

- Admin UI is first major feature to implement
- Building in phases: Sections ✅ → Users ✅ → Enrollment → Calendar
- Teacher profile pages and schedule views deferred until after admin basics complete
- Smart form pattern with "Save & Add Another" established for bulk data entry
- Multi-role users supported from V1
- Email-based mentor engagement for V1 (in-app upgrade possible in V2)
- Modal overlay reduced to 20% opacity for better visibility
- Reusable modal components for sections (SectionFormModal) and users (UserFormModal)
- Admin operations require SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for auth.admin methods
- Database trigger auto-creates basic user profiles on auth user creation
