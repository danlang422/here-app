# Work In Progress Documentation

This directory contains **temporary planning documents** for features currently under development.

## Purpose

WIP documents provide detailed specifications for active work that would clutter the main documentation. Once a feature is complete and documented in CHANGELOG.md and ARCHITECTURE.md, its WIP document should be deleted.

## Current WIP Documents

- **ADMIN_UI.md** - Detailed specifications for admin interface (sections, people, users, calendar management)

## Lifecycle

1. **Create:** When starting a major feature, create a detailed WIP doc
2. **Reference:** Use during development for UI specs, build order, open questions
3. **Delete:** Once feature is complete and reflected in permanent docs, delete the WIP doc

## Guidelines

- Be as detailed as needed for current work
- Include UI mockups, form designs, build phases
- Document open questions and decisions
- Don't worry about polish - these are working docs
- Archive or delete when done - don't let WIP docs accumulate
