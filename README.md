# Here App

A streamlined check-in/check-out application for students working remotely or at internships.

## Why This Exists

Here App simplifies remote work and internship attendance tracking by allowing students to check in and out with reflective prompts about their plans and progress. Teachers can view this data to mark attendance in Infinite Campus without managing complex attendance systems within the app itself.
